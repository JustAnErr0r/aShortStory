# aShortStory

Once upon a time, there lived a mean, angry goblin. His name was Leonard.
There'd been six of us at the outset, 
but after Smythe took a poisoned dart to the chest,
Buddlestone fell from the top of a cliff, 
Stevens and Mayhew were swallowed by quicksand, 
and Tait-Harris was eaten by ants, 
only I remained to bring you our amazing tale.
